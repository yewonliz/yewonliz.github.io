        <p>The Yi family – Jacob (Steven Yeun), Monica (Yeri Han), Anne (Noel Kate Cho), and David (Alan Kim) – move to a small town in Arkansas in 1983. Though Jacob is focused on growing Korean vegetables on his land, Monica is skeptical of his choice and wants to move to another town.</p>
        <p>After a huge argument, the couple agrees on having Monica’s mom Soonja (Yuh Jung Youn) babysit the kids while they work. Soonja soon arrives with Korean food and minari seeds, planting them in the creek nearby. Though the children are initially reluctant to accept her as a “real grandmother”, Soonja strengthens their bond over time.</p> <p>Unfortunately, she has a stroke during her sleep, which affects her movement and speech. While the rest of the family is away, Soonja accidentally tips over the can that is used to burn garbage. The fire spreads to the barn with all of Jacob’s harvests. Though they do not get to save the produce, none of them are hurt. The family ends us staying in the farm, and the movie ends with Jacob harvesting the minari at the creek. </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p>The film is set in the early 1980s, making the Yi family the third wave of Korean immigrants. According to Korean’s Immigration to the United States, the annual number of Korean immigrants steadily increased beginning in 1965, and the 30,000 mark was reached in 1976. Jacob refers to this number to assure himself and the children that the Korean vegetables he grows would be in high demand.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/koreandiaspora/issues/history-of-korean-immigration-to-america-from-1903-to-present/" target="_blank">Soojin Chung</a> explains that the high unemployment rate, political insecurity, and military dictatorship caused massive numbers of Koreans to immigrate to the United States in the 1960s through the early 1980s. These Korean immigrants were white-collar workers in Korea who voluntarily moved to America.</p>
        <p>Considering how the military dictatorship in Korea lasted from 1961 to 1987, Jacob and Monica could have immigrated from Korea to free themselves from the harsh circumstances. They are also a generation affected by the Korean War that started in 1950. Monica lost her father during the war, which led her to become the only child of the family.</p>
        <p>Soonja’s trauma from the war is revealed after she suffers a stroke. She looks at the closet and says “Hide!”, which would have been her way of surviving the war.</p>

        <h2>Why is Jacob so obsessed over land?</h2>
        <p>Throughout the movie, Jacob emphasizes how having 50 acres of land to cultivate is his dream. He even refers to the Garden of Eden after telling David that he will make a big garden.</p> 
        <p>For Jacob, having his own farmland is a proof that the family sucessfully settled in America. 
        <a href="" target="_blank">According to an article written by Andrew Chow</a>, 
        Koreans who were the first wave immigrants were barred from becoming naturalized citizens—and many states passed Alien Land Laws, making it impossible for them to buy their own farmland and control the means of production.
        </p>
        <p>Jacob, now free from this constitutionalized racism, wants to make a successful earning outside of chick sexing and become a father that his kids could be proud of.</p>
        
        <h2>What makes Minari so special?</h2>
        <p>Minari is an authentic portrayal of a Korean-American family. </p> 
        <p>The way Minari depicts the lives of Korean Americans is so different from the section in The Sympathizer by Viet Thanh Nguyen, where the Auteur writes the script according to his own stereotypes of Asians and refuses to accept the protagonist’s suggestions. The Auteur worked on the script without even doing his research or interviewing the locals on how the characters should be depicted.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Minari is based on director Issac Chung’s memories with his family, and the script was carefully edited by the actors to make them more natural.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7seLx57WVNE" target="_blank"> In a Q&A session with J.J. Abrams and star Steven Yeun</a>, Director Lee Isaac Chung explained that the script was based on 80 memories he had. His grandmother actually brought minari seeds from Korea and planted them at the creek, just like Soonja did in the movie.
        </p>
        <p>This authenticity was what made Yuh Jung Youn decide to participate in the film. <a href="https://youtu.be/csuCT6OtAZw" target="_blank"> In her interview with Jae Jae of MMTG</a>, actress Yuh Jung Youn (윤여정) mentioned that when she first got the script, the details felt so real. She asked the staff is this was a true story, and they said yes, which led her to accept Director Chung's request to play Soonja in the film.</p>
        <p>She also explained the actors' efforts to make the script authentic and natural. Steven Yeun, Yeri Han, and herself actively participated in shaping their characters. The translated Korean script of the English version was sent to the actors, and it was in a written language form, instead of being a spoken language. So the actors worked on modifying their lines to make them more natural, collaborating almost every day. 
        </p>
        <p>However, despite these efforts, the movie still faces the limitations of a translated work with was also revealed in DMZ Colony. As the movie involves both Korean and English dialogue, the English-speaking audience could only rely on the subtitles to understand the Korean parts. Due to the differences between the two languages, the subtitles could not give the American audience a completely accurate translation, including all of the nuances in Korean sentences.</p>

        <p>As the storm approaches, the roof of the mobile home starts to leak. Living in a mobile home with wheels symbolizes the family’s constant movement. The house not having a secure foundation on the ground also shows how the Yi family is yet to have a solid root in America as they are immigrants. </p>
        <p>Jacob and Monica left Korea and then lived in California and Seattle for work. Now they are settled in Arkansas, but not in a sturdy, permanent house. They are vulnerable to natural disasters such as the tornado, because just like Jacob said, “If the tornado hits, this house will fly away”. Even their electricity cuts off temporarily when lightening strikes.</p>
        <p>When the couple starts fighting in the living room and the children are making paper airplanes in another room, the English-speaking audience does not get to hear what the two are speaking anymore. The subtitles have moved onto the kids, only translating their conversation. </p>
        <p>When the couple starts fighting in the living room and the children are making paper airplanes in another room, the English-speaking audience does not get to hear what the two are speaking anymore. The subtitles have moved onto the kids, only translating their conversation. The subtitle simply puts “Jacob and Monica arguing indistinctly” for the sound of their argument, rather than translating them. </p>
        <p>Jacob is shouting, “We have to make enough sacrifices for our dream.” (꿈을 위해서는 그만큼 희생을 해야되는거야) and continues by saying “We can live happily if we hang on a bit more.” (좀만 더 버티면 우리도 행복하게 살 수 있다고) </p>
        <p>Monica replies to him asking “Until when do I have to pick up after you?” (내가 언제까지 자기 뒤치닥거리 해야되는데?)</p>
        <p>This untranslated, short argument shows Jacob’s belief in the promise of the American dream. He wants to believe that all of this hard work will pay off in the end, and that his family would be able to have a stable, happy life. However, Monica is clearly tired of following his choices and accepting the consequences due to them.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>Jacob attempts to dig his own well after sending the water diviner back. He does not believe in the water diviner, saying that it is nonsense. He calls the Americans “Stupid American bastards” (멍청한 미국놈들), which is only translated to “Americans” in the subtitles.</p>
        <p>This may be an intentional decision considering how a number of the audience reading the English subtitles are Americans. The translator or the other staff members working on the subtitles might have tried not to offend the American audience.</p> 
        <p>However, filtering out these negative comments makes it harder for the English-speaking audience to grasp that Jacob does not fully identify as American yet. Though he had spent quite a long time in the US and even uses an English name, he distances himself from the Americans when insulting them.</p>
        
        <div class = "scene">

        </div>
        <p>Monica and David react differently to Soonja’s arrival. Monica is very emotional, crying over chili powder and anchovies. Chili powder and anchovies are used in most Korean dishes, so Monica’s reaction is quite understandable. Soonja even provides Monica with money, which is later used for David’s heart checkup. </p>
        <p>David is shy and whispers in his mother’s ear that “She doesn’t look like a grandma”. Though this could be a compliment, it could also be his reaction to her not being a typical American grandma. 
        </p>
        <p>Monica and Soonja however interprets it as a compliment, and Soonja reacts happily saying “What a good boy!” (아이고 이뻐라). Though the meaning of 이뻐라 is pretty in the dictionary, it is used by Koreans as a way to say “good boy” or “good girl”. It does not necessarily have to do with physical appearances, but is a way to show love and affection towards a child, an animal, or whatever they find nice and pleasing.</p>
        <p>Soonja shows David cards (화투) and a chestnut, which Monica obviously recognizes but is new to David. Soonja peels the chestnut for him, but his gestures clearly show that he does not want to eat food that came out of his grandmother’s mouth, whom he just met.</p>
        
        <div class = "scene">
            <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ssmKzJ43Cw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>David says “Grandma, you’re not a real grandma.” and repeats this throughout the movie until he accepts her as part of the family. When Soonja asks what a “real grandma” is, one of the things he says is baking cookies. For David, who was born and raised in the US, his expectations of grandma are adjusted to that of America. A similar sentiment could be found in Tae Keller’s <a href=#More> When You Trap a Tiger</a>, where the protagonist Lily, a teenage Korean American girl, wishes her Halmoni (a Korean word for grandma, 할머니) was an ordinary American grandma.</p>
        <p>Though he speaks Korean, he also does not fully understand the underlying meaning behind his grandma’s words when she merely translates her Korean phrases into English. Thus, when Soonja calls him a “Pretty boy” intending to say "good boy", he snaps back, saying “I’m not pretty, I’m good-looking!”. He goes on to pour the Korean medicine down the drain and fill the bowl with his urine. He hands it over to Soonja instead of Mountain Dew. This time, after seeing David's negative reaction to "Pretty boy", a direct translation of the Korean version of "good boy" (아이고 예뻐라), Soonja uses the phrase "good boy".

        </div>
        <p>When he is punished for filling his grandmother’s bowl with urine, David still says that “She’s not even a real grandma…” </p>
        <p>Soonja resolves the tension within the family by trying to stop Jacob from hitting David. She also stop the quarrel between Jacob and Monica by commenting that “You two will fight over anything!”</p>
        <p>David returns with a foxtail weed instead of a proper stick for punishment, and Soonja compliments him for being witty, which saves him from any more punishment. After this, he stops blaming Soonja for not being “a real grandma”.</p>

        <div class = "scene">
            <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcnnXp8xzHA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>This scene is important in the movie as David is called a “strong boy” for the first time. Due to his heart condition, David is constantly told not to run throughout the movie. He is concerned about his health as well, as he wants to listen to his heartbeat when Monica monitors them. However, Soonja’s compliment encourages him to challenge himself and haul water from the minari creek when the mobile home’s water stops. </p>
        <p>Soonja’s compliment also resolves the negative feeling David had towards her, as he jokingly asks, “What does pee taste like?” and runs away giggling. </p>
        <p>Throughout the movie, the three generations of the family are distinguished in the way they speak. The way Soonja calls David in this scene is a great example of those language differences. Soonja, being a Korean, usually uses Korean. Even when calling David by his English name, she incorporates a Korean grammar and pronunciation rule. </p>
        <p>Jacob, who has been living in the US for a while, adds English words to his Korean sentences. His sentences are at times not grammatically correct. He is still more comfortable using Korean than English. </p>
        <p>Lastly, as Anne and David were born and raised in the US, they would consider themselves more American than Korean and feel more comfortable with using English. <a href = #preview> At the beginning of the movie</a>, the audience could notice Anne reading an English book in the car. The childrens' first lines in the movie are also in English, and they use English to talk to themselves. Anne saying "This just gets better and better." to herself at 00:13 is one of those exmaples.</p>
        <p>At 00:58 in this scene, Soonja says David-ah to call David. The ah part is a Korean grammatical rule. When referring to an individual by their name, Koreans put 아 (ah) or야 (yah) depending on whether their name ends with a vowel or not. For example my name, 예원 (Yewon) ends with ㄴ, which is not a vowel. Thus, my Korean-speaking family and friends say 예원아 (Yewon-ah) to call me. For an individual named 선우 (Sunwoo), people would call them 선우야 (Sunwoo-yah), as their name ends with an ㅜ, a vowel. The same rule is applied to David’s name. 데이빗 (David) ends with ㅅ, which is not a vowel. Soonja therefore uses 아 (ah) after his name, calling him 데이빗아 (David-ah). </p>
        <p>She also makes it even closer to the Korean language by using the Korean pronunciation rule of linking sound. Through the rule, a bottom consonant from a block is linked with the beginning sound in the next block. 데이빗아 (David-ah) becomes 데이비사 (Davisa) after the linking sound rule is applied. Soonja also changes the v sound to a b sound, as Korean does not have any consonants that make the v sound. Thus, with the Korean grammatical and pronouciation rules applied, David is called “Daibisa” by Soonja.</p>
        <p>Jacob, Monica, and Anne on the other hand, only call David by his name, without the -ah part. This difference however is not explained or pointed out in the subtitle. For the easy comprehension of the English-speaking audience, Soonja’s “Dabisa” and others’ “David” are both written as “David” in the subtitles. Thus, the English-speaking audience would not know in depth how each character’s use of language is different.</p>

        <div class = "scene">
            <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QafSelNVYDE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>Soonja asks David if he wants to run with her, becoming the first grownup that suggests running together. She understands that he might want to run, as he is always told not to. Though David refuses as he is concerned with his heart condition, this question later encourages him to run after Soonja when she is walking away from the barn after it catches fire.</p>
        <p>The two spend time together at minari creek, strengthening the bond between themselves. The minari has grown on its own, contrary to the hard work Jacob had to put in to keep his produce growing. For a family that always struggles to maintain their everyday lives, the minari growing without any work put into it makes it special.</p>
        <p>David starts to sing the minari song. This is based on Director Chung's experience with his grandmother at the minari creek, where he would sing songs about minari.</p>
